*qunatum Dot Preparation
The quantum Dots where prepared following the colloidal approach introduced Murray et al. [2]. In this work a procedure was done that was
described by Boatman et al. [1].
This procedure consists of three steps : preparation of selenium and cadmium solutions, heating and mixing both solutions and extracting the
quantum Dots.
For the first step, 37 mg of Selen (Se) were dissolved in 5 ml ODE (C H ), mixed with 0.4 ml TOP;
In a different reservoir, 13 mg Cadmiumoxide (CdO) were dissolved in 10 ml ODE and 0.6 ml oleic acid.

The second step consisted of heating the Cadmium solution up to 225Â°C [with a Heizpilz] and adding 1 ml of the Selen solution, while keeping the 
temperature constant. By adding the Selen the nucleation reaction is started. The high temperatures allow the QDs to grow up to
the size of several nm.

The investigation by Svenja Herberts show that after a time of ~200 seconds the growth of QDs size stops,
which indicates that the growth mechanism comes to an equilibrium at that stage.

The extraction of QD was performed after 200s growth with a time interval of 15 s in between different samples
[with a Glasspippette]. All samples emit red color, when exposed to visible light.
